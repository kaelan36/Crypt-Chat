Crypt-Chat is a chatting application that uses asymmetrical cryptography to keep communications hidden. There are two parts to the project: the server/server creation and the client-side GUI. To create a server 'seed', use the createServer.py program and follow the prompts. To start your server, run the server.py program and input the path for the JSON seed that was made. It will then run the server and allow for connections. To connect to the server as client, run the main.py program and select the same JSON file used to load the server; this file not only acts as a 'seed' for the server, but also as a key to get into the server. Then, you can use the application with a chatroom-like function.
